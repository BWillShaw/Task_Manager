# Task Manager

This README file will help you understand what each file and folder in the project does. 

## How the Project is Organized

Here's what the structure of a typical Django project looks like:

```
myproject/
|-- myproject/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- asgi.py
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- wsgi.py
|-- myapp/
|   |-- admin.py
|   |-- apps.py
|   |-- migrations/
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- models.py
|   |-- tests.py
|   |-- views.py
|-- manage.py
```

### Top-Level Project Folder

- `myproject/`: This is the main folder that holds everything related to your project.

### Main Configuration Folder

- `myproject/myproject/`: This folder contains files that control the settings and behavior of your entire project.

  - `__init__.py`: This file is mostly empty and tells Python that this folder can be treated like a Python package, or a collection of Python files.
  
  - `asgi.py`: This file helps your Django project work with web servers that are compatible with ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). This basically means how your web application communicates asynchronously.
  
  - `settings.py`: This is where you set up things like which database to use, where your static files (like images and CSS) are, and other configurations.
  
  - `urls.py`: This file is like a map for your project. It tells Django what should happen when different paths (URLs) are visited on your website.
  
  - `wsgi.py`: Similar to `asgi.py`, but for web servers that work with WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface). This is a more traditional, synchronous way for web servers and your project to talk to each other.

### Your App Folder

- `myapp/`: This folder is for one of your applications (or 'apps'). In Django, a project can have multiple apps, which are like smaller components that handle different things.

  - `admin.py`: This file allows you to set up a nice admin interface for your app where you can manage data.
  
  - `apps.py`: This file contains some settings that are specific to this app.
  
  - `migrations/`: This folder contains files that help Django keep track of any changes you make to your data models, so they can be applied to your database.
  
    - `__init__.py`: Like the other `__init__.py`, this tells Python that this folder is a Python package.
  
  - `models.py`: Here, you define what kind of data your app will handle and what that data will look like.
  
  - `tests.py`: This is where you can write tests to make sure your app is working as expected.
  
  - `views.py`: This file decides what the user will see when they visit different parts of your website.

    - **Front-end Code**: [PLACEHOLDER]

### Utility Script

- `manage.py`: This is a handy tool you can use from your command line to interact with your project. For example, you can start your development server, create a new app, and more.
